Read me file Recipe app The point of this recipe app its for adding items in the system, edit and delete. This app is supposed to help the user when making recipes. How To Run open program class and run program. add information according to what's being asked edit or delete items according to you're wish made a new changes to the code itself less errors
I made a few updates to the system. Added a new option in the searching option. It displays the custom search and all recipes in the system.
The delete method has two option delete one recipe or all of them.
The code itself had major changes with the whole input code being updated and changed to a simpler version of it and having less errors.
The code still executes the same so there wonâ€™t be any major changes for the execution for now.
